ðŸ’¡ Reflections
This was my first day exploring PowerShell as a system administration tool. I understood the basics of listing and filtering system data, which will be crucial in monitoring and automation tasks later on.

I also learned how to chain commands using pipes (|) to refine and format output. This will be very helpful when writing scripts that need to analyze or export system data.
